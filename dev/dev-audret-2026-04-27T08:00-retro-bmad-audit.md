## Goal
Run `bmad-retrospective` on epic-bmad-audit and append findings to `LEARN.md § epic-bmad-audit`. Interim substitute for Phase 5's `epic-retro-agent` + `epic-learn-agent`.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `bmad-retrospective` invoked against this epic's shipped stories (aud101, aud102, aud103)
- [ ] `LEARN.md § epic-bmad-audit` appended: what worked, what didn't, proposed changes (spec template / skill prompts / CLAUDE.md / `devx.config.yaml` / docs), each entry tagged with confidence (low/med/high) + blast radius (memory/skill/template/config/docs/code)
- [ ] Low-blast-radius items applied in this PR (memory + doc edits); higher-blast items filed as MANUAL.md rows or new dev specs (referenced from the LEARN.md row)
- [ ] PR merged with the LEARN.md update

## Technical notes
- Convention defined at `docs/ROADMAP.md` § Locked decisions — "Interim retro discipline"
- Superseded by `epic-retro-agent` + `epic-learn-agent` (Phase 5); `LearnAgent` will ingest LEARN.md content when those land
- If any story in this epic carries `Requires user action` and is unshipped at retro time, run retro on what shipped and call out the open story in LEARN.md as `pending`

## Status log
- 2026-04-27 — created by interim retro discipline (ROADMAP.md locked decision)
- 2026-04-27T10:50 — claimed by /devx; corrected `branch:` from `develop/dev-audret` to `feat/dev-audret` per cross-epic finding (planner default vs `git.integration_branch: null` config)
- 2026-04-27T10:50 — branched off main HEAD which carries unpushed commit `1b8edb3` ("interim retro discipline + Phase 0 learnings"); reset local main back to origin/main so the audret PR carries the infra commit through CI rather than bypassing it
- 2026-04-27T10:55 — PR #19 opened: https://github.com/LeoTheMighty/devx/pull/19
- 2026-04-27T11:00 — formal `bmad-retrospective` synthesis pass complete (analytical workflow run against aud101–aud103 status logs + `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/bmad-audit.md`; party-mode-dialogue facilitation steps skipped per autonomous YOLO mode + interim retro discipline targeting `LEARN.md` rather than `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-N-retro-DATE.md`). BMAD-shaped sibling artifact written to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-bmad-audit-retro-2026-04-27.md`. `LEARN.md § epic-bmad-audit` extended with five new findings (E1–E5) reconciled against the existing four hand-extracted entries. Low-blast item E1 applied: `bmad-agent-qa` ghost reference replaced with `bmad-tea` in `.claude/commands/devx-plan.md` and `.claude/commands/dev-plan.md` (per `bmad-audit.md` §4.2 row 1). E2–E5 noted as `pending-concordance` (single-epic evidence; will revisit at next retro or when LearnAgent lands).
- 2026-04-27T11:10 — local CI green (typecheck clean, 250/250 vitest tests). Pushed to PR #19; remote CI passed both runners (macos-latest + ubuntu-latest, run 25008321286). Squash-merged to main as 7444b11 via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. Status: done.
