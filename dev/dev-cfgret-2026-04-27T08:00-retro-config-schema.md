## Goal
Run `bmad-retrospective` on epic-config-schema and append findings to `LEARN.md § epic-config-schema`. Interim substitute for Phase 5's `epic-retro-agent` + `epic-learn-agent`.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `bmad-retrospective` invoked against this epic's shipped stories (cfg201, cfg202, cfg203, cfg204)
- [ ] `LEARN.md § epic-config-schema` appended: what worked, what didn't, proposed changes (spec template / skill prompts / CLAUDE.md / `devx.config.yaml` / docs), each entry tagged with confidence (low/med/high) + blast radius (memory/skill/template/config/docs/code)
- [ ] Low-blast-radius items applied in this PR (memory + doc edits); higher-blast items filed as MANUAL.md rows or new dev specs (referenced from the LEARN.md row)
- [ ] PR merged with the LEARN.md update

## Technical notes
- Convention defined at `docs/ROADMAP.md` § Locked decisions — "Interim retro discipline"
- Superseded by `epic-retro-agent` + `epic-learn-agent` (Phase 5); `LearnAgent` will ingest LEARN.md content when those land
- If any story in this epic carries `Requires user action` and is unshipped at retro time, run retro on what shipped and call out the open story in LEARN.md as `pending`

## Status log
- 2026-04-27 — created by interim retro discipline (ROADMAP.md locked decision)
- 2026-04-27T11:05 — claimed by /devx; corrected `branch:` from `develop/dev-cfgret` to `feat/dev-cfgret` per cross-epic finding (planner default vs `git.integration_branch: null` config). Same fix every prior story has had to apply.
- 2026-04-27T11:25 — formal `bmad-retrospective` synthesis pass complete (analytical workflow run against cfg201–cfg204 status logs + `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epic-config-schema.md`; party-mode-dialogue facilitation steps skipped per autonomous YOLO mode + interim retro discipline targeting `LEARN.md`). BMAD-shaped sibling artifact written to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-config-schema-retro-2026-04-27.md`. `LEARN.md § epic-config-schema` extended with seven new findings (E1–E7) reconciled against the four hand-extracted entries. Low-blast items applied: (a) CLAUDE.md "Working agreements" gains explicit **Self-review is non-skippable** bullet (resolves cross-epic-patterns pending-CLAUDE-confirmation); (b) CLAUDE.md "How /devx runs" rewritten to reflect single-branch reality (`feat/dev-<hash>` off `main`, `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`, claim-commit-push-before-PR rule, bmad-create-story drift acknowledgement) — resolves E5; (c) `epic-config-schema.md` line 122 user-config-path locked-decision updated from `~/.devx/` cross-platform to XDG-on-Linux + `~/.devx/` on macOS+WSL per "fix the loser" rule — resolves E4; (d) cfg201's `sprint-status.yaml` row flipped `backlog` → `done` (in-scope, same epic) — partial resolution of E3; (e) `MANUAL.md` MP0.1 filed for user decision on backfilling aud101–103 + sup405 stale rows — remainder of E3; (f) E7 verified no-op (CONFIG.md schema-path text already corrected). E1 (bmad-create-story silent skip), E2 (retros not in sprint-status.yaml), E6 (stub-policy carve-out) noted as `pending-concordance` for next retro / first LearnAgent pass. Cross-epic patterns gained two promoted rows: bmad-create-story drift (4/4 epics ≥3 threshold) + CLAUDE.md `develop`-branch staleness (single-instance promotion of a docs-self-consistency rule).
